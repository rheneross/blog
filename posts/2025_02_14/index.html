<meta name=title content="Strike!"><meta name=description content="Hey everyone,
I hope you are all doing great!
This week, something really important happened in the game&rsquo;s industry: a Strike!
Started by a French union&mdash;the STJV&mdash;the movement was also joined by CSVI-CGT in Spain. You can read their demands here.
If you want to support the effort, an itch.io game bundle was created, with a lot of great games like Pyrene or Minami Lane!
And apparently, the strike was a success!

Strikes in 3 countries, more than 1000 people at our rallies across France, and even more on strike for our working conditions and our jobs' future.
