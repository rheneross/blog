The MuskTrumpxiety is hitting hard, and I don&rsquo;t even live in the US.
I guess that&rsquo;s what happens when fascists are in charge of one of the most powerful countries in the world.
I hope you are all safe, wherever you are.
Clearing socials
I&rsquo;ve always kept my distance from social media. I have a LinkedIn account (asleep when I&rsquo;m not job hunting), as well as Reddit and Bluesky accounts.
I do use WhatsApp, but since Zuckerbro has pledged allegiance to the Trumpsks, I&rsquo;m moving away from it.
It is a slow and hard process: You need to ask all your contacts to move to something else&mdash;Signal in this case&mdash;and people don&rsquo;t want to install yet another messaging app.
Still, I&rsquo;m already facing the final boss: migrating the family group chat. Classic text messages will do for everyone else.

It was so frustrating, and as always, the issue turned out to be a dumb mistake. Working alone on something can be hard when you&rsquo;re stuck and need a fresh perspective&mldr; But it&rsquo;s all working now, so I&rsquo;ll celebrate by taking a break!<br>Next week, I&rsquo;ll work on adding textures.</p><p>I can already feel some friction in the new texture workflow: adding them to Hammer++ requires converting my .png files to .vtf format and generating a .vmf material file.
It also means my engine will have to support .vtf and .vmf files. Alternatively, I could switch to Trenchbroom + ericw-tools with flat .png textures, which might be enough to achieve the look Iâ€™m after.<br>That&rsquo;s a decision for next-week me.</p><p>Well, that was my week. Here&rsquo;s hoping yours went smoother!<br>See you next time.</p></content><p><a class=blog-tags href=/tags/life/>#life</a>
