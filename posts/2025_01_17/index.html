<meta name=title content="Hard at work"><meta name=description content="Hey!
Hope everyone&rsquo;s doing great :)
This was my 2nd work week of 2025, and wow, it was PACKED!
Outside of my current freelance project, I&rsquo;ve been working on a game framework for my first commercial solo game, built with odin-lang and sokol.
My goal is to be able to build levels in hammer++&mdash;with a working compile & run action&mdash;and develop custom entities and game logic in odin.
Progress this week?
You bet! We can now:"><meta name=author content><meta name=keywords content="gamedev,"><meta property="og:title" content="Hard at work"><meta property="og:description" content="Hey!

We can now:</p><ul><li>Move and look around in first person</li><li>Render simple 3D shapes</li><li>Load Source 2013 .bsp files</li><li>Spawn the player at the <code>info_player_start</code> position, and find its location in the BSP Tree.</li></ul><p>Next up, I&rsquo;ll focus on rendering maps&mdash;starting without textures. Then I&rsquo;ll create the entrypoints & configuration to launch the game directly into the current map from Hammer++.
I aim to have everything setup by the end of the month, so I can start working on the actual game: a really small game where you try to exit a bunker without waking up the monster sleeping below.</p><p>I was also planning on releasing the new BugBee update, but I didn&rsquo;t get around to finishing it, maybe next week ðŸ¤ž.</p><p>I&rsquo;m itching to get back to work, so I&rsquo;ll keep this short for today!<br>Thanks for following along, and see you next time :)</p></content><p><a class=blog-tags href=/tags/gamedev/>#gamedev</a></p></main><footer><small><a href=https://blog.thibaud.io/index.xml>RSS</a> | <a href=https://bsky.app/profile/rheneross.com>bluesky</a> | Made with <a href=https://github.com/clente/hugo-bearcub>Bear Cub</a></small></footer></body></html>
