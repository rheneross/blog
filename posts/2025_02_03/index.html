Hey everyone,
This week I wanted to talk about task management again.
Well, actually, it&rsquo;s more about doing the work.
Basically, last week was a mess.
I did not finish the pre-production of my game and this post is very late.
So, what happened?
Distractions
One of the first things I blame when I feel like I didn&rsquo;t achieve as much, is task management.
I know, it&rsquo;s ridiculous."><meta name=author content><meta name=keywords content="life,"><meta property="og:title" content="It's not that I'm not organized"><meta property="og:description" content="It&rsquo;s that I am simply not working.

Yesterday, I spent an entire hour looking for a farm to buy in the middle of nowhere&mldr;</p><p>But yeah, it must be task management. So let&rsquo;s rebuild how I capture, schedule and organize tasks. Let&rsquo;s update my Obsidian dashboard, and maybe some of my neovim configuration&mldr;</p><h2 id=reflecting>Reflecting</h2><p>Stop. Put down the yaml file.<br>What did I really do last week?</p><p>One thing in particular I&rsquo;m happy with: I did release <a href=https://bugbee.app>BugBee</a>&rsquo;s new update, and I did start to talk about it.
Outside of all the procrastination we already discussed, I also delivered the freelance I was paid for.</p><p>So, I should feel pretty good about last week, right?<br>Well, it&rsquo;s not so simple, because there&rsquo;s a big difference between what I want to be doing, and what I have to do.</p><h3 id=what-i-want-to-be-doing>What I want to be doing</h3><p>In my wildest dreams, I want to take care of a small farm, raising a mix of animals and cultivating veggies, while still making small solo indie games.
In my head, I imagine working mostly in the farm from March to October, with a bit of time for game dev, and working mostly on games from November to February.</p><h3 id=what-i-need-to-be-doing>What I need to be doing</h3><p>At the moment though, I need to provide for my family, so I basically need to work.<br>While I&rsquo;m waiting for the big move though, I am learning and preparing by growing some vegetables in my backyard, along with some hens. I&rsquo;m also working on a solo game&mdash;whose pre-production I did not finish in time.</p><h2 id=sometimes-it-is-organization>Sometimes, it is organization</h2><p>What&rsquo;s tricky is, sometimes it <strong>is</strong> a task management issue.<br>This morning I spent 10 minutes organizing my week, and by the end of the day I accomplished more than last Thursday and Friday combined.</p><p>Sometimes a little structure really does help. Either way, I&rsquo;m going to keep trying. See you Friday!</p></content><p><a class=blog-tags href=/tags/life/>#life</a></p></main><footer><small><a href=https://blog.thibaud.io/index.xml>RSS</a> | <a href=https://bsky.app/profile/rheneross.com>bluesky</a> | Made with <a href=https://github.com/clente/hugo-bearcub>Bear Cub</a></small></footer></body></html>
