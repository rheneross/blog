&lt;p>This week I&amp;rsquo;ve made a lot of progress on my game: the first level blockout is nearly complete, and all the features are implemented already.&lt;br>

I hope you are doing great :)</p>
<p>This week I&rsquo;ve made a lot of progress on my game: the first level blockout is nearly complete, and all the features are implemented already.<br>
I will do a small family and friends playtest next week, and report back with the findings!</p>
<p>In the meantime, let&rsquo;s dive a little bit into my Trenchbroom/Godot/FuncGodot setup.</p>
<p>First, let me tell you, I really enjoy the workflow!<br>
Here&rsquo;s a quick video showing it in action:<br>

</p>
<p>At the moment though, it&rsquo;s a bit tedious to add new 3D models.<br>
Here&rsquo;s what I have to do to make a model available in Trenchbroom:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create the model in blender, with the materials</li>
<li>Export the model as an glb to Godot</li>
<li>Create a Godot scene, with the model in it, rotate it to face the correct direction</li>
<li>Create an entity resource using the model</li>
<li>Export the entities library</li>
<li>Reload the entities in trenchbroom</li>
</ol>
<p>Next week, I&rsquo;ll create a Godot tool script to automatically generate props entities for each 3D model in a folder.</p>
<p>For reference, here&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;ve structured my project:</p>

</p>
<p>The closest rally were more than 2 hours from where I live, so I observed the strike in my own way&mdash;by playing through <em>A Plague&rsquo;s Tale: Innocence</em>.<br>
I really enjoyed the game: the story hooked me right away, and I loved sneaking around guards and breaking their lanterns so they get swarmed by rats. Some said the infiltration was on rail, it didn&rsquo;t bother me at all.<br>
The only thing I found a little bit annoying was the menu to change projectiles.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also started Kingdom Come: Deliverance, the first one.<br>
I&rsquo;m enjoying it so far, even though I must avoid an entire road because someone I&rsquo;ve beaten in a Tourney is looking to kill me with a poison blade.<br>
We&rsquo;ll see what comes next!</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for this week, see you all next time!</p>

&lt;p>This week, I started the production on my game, and I hope I&amp;rsquo;ll have something to show you pretty soon!
For now, I&amp;rsquo;m implementing all the entities I need inside a test level&amp;mdash;which doesn&amp;rsquo;t make for an impressive screenshot:&lt;br>

<h2 id="blender-as-hammer">Blender as Hammer</h2>
<p>Yesterday, I saw some interesting posts by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/passivestar.bsky.social">passivestar</a> about using Blender as a Valve&rsquo;s Hammer level editor:</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/passivestar.bsky.social/post/3lgwiyfm2y22s">Polyhaven + ucupaint</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the list of Blender addons they are using:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://omnistep.atair.cc/">omnistep</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/passivestar/quickmenu">quickmenu</a></li>

<li><a href="https://extensions.blender.org/add-ons/copy-attributes-menu/">Copy Attributes Menu</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The workflow looked really smooth&mdash;also because they look amazing at Blender&mdash;and I started to think that I should try that for my game.</p>
<h2 id="resisting-the-sirens-of-procrastination">Resisting the sirens of procrastination</h2>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a trap I frequently fall into: trying to radically change my workflow after production has started&mdash;even if I quite like my current tools.
Especially for small games, it&rsquo;s often better to pin new techniques for later.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not only me, I&rsquo;ve seen countless productions where the team wanted to upgrade to the new major engine version, not to solve a problem, but to integrate a new tool.
It always leads to losing days fixing issues, while the new tool gets slowly abandoned because nothing is built to work with it in the current content pipeline.</p>
<p>Even early in production, I&rsquo;ll force myself to stick to my workflow&mdash;I have a game to make!</p>
<p>Have a great week, see you next time!</p>

<p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p>This week I wanted to talk about task management again.<br>
Well, actually, it&rsquo;s more about doing the work.</p>
<p>Basically, last week was a mess.<br>
I did not finish the pre-production of my game and this post is very late.</p>
<p>So, what happened?</p>
<h2 id="distractions">Distractions</h2>
<p>One of the first things I blame when I feel like I didn&rsquo;t achieve as much, is task management.<br>
I know, it&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>Most of the time, the issue is Twitch, Youtube or whatever new horrible thing the government did yesterday.<br>
Suddenly I&rsquo;m learning how that guy did this, how to graft fruit trees, or how to get involved and try to stop the rise of fascism.
Yesterday, I spent an entire hour looking for a farm to buy in the middle of nowhere&hellip;</p>
<p>But yeah, it must be task management. So let&rsquo;s rebuild how I capture, schedule and organize tasks. Let&rsquo;s update my Obsidian dashboard, and maybe some of my neovim configuration&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="reflecting">Reflecting</h2>
<p>Stop. Put down the yaml file.<br>
What did I really do last week?</p>
<p>One thing in particular I&rsquo;m happy with: I did release <a href="https://bugbee.app">BugBee</a>&rsquo;s new update, and I did start to talk about it.
Outside of all the procrastination we already discussed, I also delivered the freelance I was paid for.</p>
<p>So, I should feel pretty good about last week, right?<br>
Well, it&rsquo;s not so simple, because there&rsquo;s a big difference between what I want to be doing, and what I have to do.</p>
<h3 id="what-i-want-to-be-doing">What I want to be doing</h3>
<p>In my wildest dreams, I want to take care of a small farm, raising a mix of animals and cultivating veggies, while still making small solo indie games.
In my head, I imagine working mostly in the farm from March to October, with a bit of time for game dev, and working mostly on games from November to February.</p>
<h3 id="what-i-need-to-be-doing">What I need to be doing</h3>
<p>At the moment though, I need to provide for my family, so I basically need to work.<br>
While I&rsquo;m waiting for the big move though, I am learning and preparing by growing some vegetables in my backyard, along with some hens. I&rsquo;m also working on a solo game&mdash;whose pre-production I did not finish in time.</p>
<h2 id="sometimes-it-is-organization">Sometimes, it is organization</h2>
<p>What&rsquo;s tricky is, sometimes it <strong>is</strong> a task management issue.<br>
This morning I spent 10 minutes organizing my week, and by the end of the day I accomplished more than last Thursday and Friday combined.</p>
<p>Sometimes a little structure really does help. Either way, I&rsquo;m going to keep trying. See you Friday!</p>

The &lt;em>MuskTrumpxiety&lt;/em> is hitting hard, and I don&amp;rsquo;t even live in the US.&lt;br>

I hope you are all safe, wherever you are.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="clearing-socials">Clearing socials&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve always kept my distance from social media. I have a LinkedIn account (asleep when I&amp;rsquo;m not job hunting), as well as Reddit and Bluesky accounts.
I do use WhatsApp, but since Zuckerbro has pledged allegiance to the Trumpsks, I&amp;rsquo;m moving away from it.&lt;br>
It is a slow and hard process: You need to ask all your contacts to move to something else&amp;mdash;&lt;a href="https://signal.org">Signal&lt;/a> in this case&amp;mdash;and people don&amp;rsquo;t want to install yet another messaging app.
Still, I&amp;rsquo;m already facing the final boss: migrating the family group chat. Classic text messages will do for everyone else.&lt;br>
Wish me luck!&lt;/p></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What an HORRIBLE week!<br>
The <em>MuskTrumpxiety</em> is hitting hard, and I don&rsquo;t even live in the US.<br>
I guess that&rsquo;s what happens when fascists are in charge of one of the most powerful countries in the world.
I hope you are all safe, wherever you are.</p>
<h2 id="clearing-socials">Clearing socials</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always kept my distance from social media. I have a LinkedIn account (asleep when I&rsquo;m not job hunting), as well as Reddit and Bluesky accounts.
I do use WhatsApp, but since Zuckerbro has pledged allegiance to the Trumpsks, I&rsquo;m moving away from it.<br>
It is a slow and hard process: You need to ask all your contacts to move to something else&mdash;<a href="https://signal.org">Signal</a> in this case&mdash;and people don&rsquo;t want to install yet another messaging app.
Still, I&rsquo;m already facing the final boss: migrating the family group chat. Classic text messages will do for everyone else.<br>
Wish me luck!</p>
<h2 id="engine-progress">Engine progress</h2>
<p>In other news, I spent 3 days figuring out why my engine wouldn&rsquo;t render the .bsp map I had loaded. It was so frustrating, and as always, the issue turned out to be a dumb mistake. Working alone on something can be hard when you&rsquo;re stuck and need a fresh perspective&hellip; But it&rsquo;s all working now, so I&rsquo;ll celebrate by taking a break!<br>
Next week, I&rsquo;ll work on adding textures.</p>
<p>I can already feel some friction in the new texture workflow: adding them to Hammer++ requires converting my .png files to .vtf format and generating a .vmf material file.
It also means my engine will have to support .vtf and .vmf files. Alternatively, I could switch to Trenchbroom + ericw-tools with flat .png textures, which might be enough to achieve the look I’m after.<br>
That&rsquo;s a decision for next-week me.</p>
<p>Well, that was my week. Here&rsquo;s hoping yours went smoother!<br>
See you next time.</p>

My goal is to be able to build levels in &lt;a href="https://ficool2.github.io/HammerPlusPlus-Website/index.html">hammer++&lt;/a>&amp;mdash;with a working compile &amp;amp; run action&amp;mdash;and develop custom entities and game logic in odin.&lt;/p>

<p>Outside of my current freelance project, I&rsquo;ve been working on a game framework for my first commercial solo game, built with odin-lang and sokol.
My goal is to be able to build levels in <a href="https://ficool2.github.io/HammerPlusPlus-Website/index.html">hammer++</a>&mdash;with a working compile &amp; run action&mdash;and develop custom entities and game logic in odin.</p>
<p><strong>Progress this week?</strong><br>
You bet! We can now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Move and look around in first person</li>
<li>Render simple 3D shapes</li>
<li>Load Source 2013 .bsp files</li>
<li>Spawn the player at the <code>info_player_start</code> position, and find its location in the BSP Tree.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next up, I&rsquo;ll focus on rendering maps&mdash;starting without textures. Then I&rsquo;ll create the entrypoints &amp; configuration to launch the game directly into the current map from Hammer++.
I aim to have everything setup by the end of the month, so I can start working on the actual game: a really small game where you try to exit a bunker without waking up the monster sleeping below.</p>
<p>I was also planning on releasing the new BugBee update, but I didn&rsquo;t get around to finishing it, maybe next week 🤞.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m itching to get back to work, so I&rsquo;ll keep this short for today!<br>
Thanks for following along, and see you next time :)</p>

&lt;p>First I had this &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYtGl1dX5qI">old song&lt;/a> stuck in my head for most of the week. Sorry, I had to &lt;em>let it all out&lt;/em>!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="morning-pages">Morning Pages&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve started writing three A4 pages every morning before work. It&amp;rsquo;s excruciating&amp;mdash;I dread the moment all the way to my office&amp;mdash;but &lt;em>boy&lt;/em> does it feel good when it&amp;rsquo;s done.
It&amp;rsquo;s all coming from the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Artist%27s_Way">Artist&amp;rsquo;s Way&lt;/a> by Julia Cameron, and while I don&amp;rsquo;t enjoy the spiritual aspects of the book, I find the method interesting. I will be continuing the exercises through the start of the year, and try to report back on my progress here.&lt;/p></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s time to look back on the first work week of 2025 :)</p>
<p>First I had this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYtGl1dX5qI">old song</a> stuck in my head for most of the week. Sorry, I had to <em>let it all out</em>!</p>
<h2 id="morning-pages">Morning Pages</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve started writing three A4 pages every morning before work. It&rsquo;s excruciating&mdash;I dread the moment all the way to my office&mdash;but <em>boy</em> does it feel good when it&rsquo;s done.
It&rsquo;s all coming from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Artist%27s_Way">Artist&rsquo;s Way</a> by Julia Cameron, and while I don&rsquo;t enjoy the spiritual aspects of the book, I find the method interesting. I will be continuing the exercises through the start of the year, and try to report back on my progress here.</p>
<h2 id="multi-project-ing">Multi-project-ing</h2>
<p>Already, I found a positive side-effect of the morning pages: they help me sort my thoughts before starting the day.<br>
That &ldquo;<em>enlightenment</em>&rdquo; also pushed me to change the way I juggle my multiple projects.</p>
<p>Previously, I merged all my tasks into one massive todo list then, every morning, I would sit at my desk and select the tasks I needed to work on for the day&mdash;then proceed to work all day on completely different things.</p>
<p>Now, each task lives in a different place:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal / Administrative tasks: in Todoist, which I sort and prioritize every now and then</li>
<li>Client tasks: in the client task management system</li>
<li>Personal project tasks: in their own repository</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, every morning, after writing my pages, I check with myself if I want to work on one project or another, then proceed to work on tasks related to this project.<br>
If something urgent needs to be done, it&rsquo;s usually top of mind, so I handle it immediately.</p>
<p>With this new organization, I no longer feel like like I&rsquo;m behind on tasks. Instead, I&rsquo;m more focused on what I want to work one&mdash;like BugBee!</p>
<h2 id="bugbee">BugBee</h2>
<p><a href="https://bugbee.app">BugBee</a> is a Discord bot designed to help studios manage game feedback and bug reports efficiently. Currently, it allows you to gather player inputs directly from Discord.</p>
<p>With the next update&mdash;which should be live next week&mdash;I&rsquo;m adding an API that lets developers integrate feedback submission directly from their games. All reports will be funneled into the same Discord feedback channel, making it easy to track them. It&rsquo;s the final feature I wanted before actively talking about it!</p>
<h2 id="game1-pre-production">Game1 Pre-Production</h2>
<p>I also made some progress on selecting a content workflow for my next game. My current prototype, built with Godot + <a href="https://github.com/func-godot/func_godot_plugin">FuncGodot</a> + <a href="https://trenchbroom.github.io/">TrenchBroom</a>, works really well for what I want to achieve, buuuuut I wanted to try one last approach: I&rsquo;m experimenting with a prototype built without Godot, instead using <a href="https://odin-lang.org/">Odin</a> + <a href="https://github.com/floooh/sokol">Sokol</a> and having it load bsp maps from <a href="https://ficool2.github.io/HammerPlusPlus-Website/">Hammer++</a>.
I really like working without an editor&mdash;except for making maps obviously.</p>
<p>That said, I really need to get better at making levels :)</p>
<h2 id="i-also-played-some-games">I also played some games</h2>
<h3 id="enshrouded">Enshrouded</h3>
<p>This week, I tried Enshrouded with some friends and we all enjoyed it!<br>
What I like about it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Same feeling of exploration I had with Valheim, but less punitive</li>
<li>Magic chests that act as a remote inventory for crafting</li>
<li>Meaningful loots from monsters, not everything is obtained by crafting</li>
</ul>
<p>Things I don&rsquo;t like that much:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using NPC for crafting, I spend my time in base looking for them</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="balatro">Balatro</h3>
<p>I know I&rsquo;m late to the Balatro party, but I&rsquo;m glad I finally came: it&rsquo;s a hell of a party!<br>
Like everyone else, I&rsquo;m addicted!</p>
<hr>
<p>I believe that&rsquo;s all for this week!<br>
Talk to you next time :)</p>

<p>I hope you all had a wonderful end of the year.
Not to be a Bilbo Braggins <strong>but</strong> I had the best New Year&rsquo;s Eve party ever: I went to bed at 22:30! Oh, the delights of old age.</p>
<h2 id="2024-was-a-big-year-for-me">2024 was a big year for me!</h2>
<p>I wanted to work as a freelancer for about 10 years now, and I finally took the jump last February. I started with a perfect first contract: a year-long project, which gave me plenty of time to adjust to the new required  administrative chores, without worrying too much about finding gigs. It was also the opportunity to work with Unreal Engine, which I didn&rsquo;t do professionally before.</p>
<p>By summer, I was feeling quite comfortable&mdash;read bored&mdash;in my new life and decided to focus on making a game of my own. After working on a grant application for a while, I realized my initial idea was too ambitious for a first project. So, I decided to shelve it for now and focus on something smaller&mdash;something I could complete by myself before mid-2025. Eventually, I settled on a small, liminal Half-Life game, set in the universe of my &ldquo;big game&rdquo;.</p>
<p>After having to&mdash;emotionally&mdash;survive a surgical procedure in September, I also became more mindful of my health. I started improving my diet and exercising regularly, loosing 5 kg in 4 months.</p>
<p>Another highlight of the year was shipping the first alpha version of <a href="https://bugbee.app">BugBee</a>, a Discord bot designed to help studios manage game feedback. There&rsquo;s still one key feature I&rsquo;d like to add before starting to talk about it thought.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for 2024, let&rsquo;s see what the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAE9AgseCW8">sequel</a> has in store!</p>
<h2 id="2025">2025</h2>
<p>With my current freelancing project coming to an end in February, I can support myself until October included. As I discussed in a <a href="/posts/2024_12_13/">previous post</a>, I&rsquo;m fully anxious about the deadline, but before focusing on finding a new freelance contract, I want to release a game. So I made a quick plan for the start of the year.</p>
<h3 id="the-plan">The plan</h3>
<p><strong>Jan. 2025</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Add an endpoint in <a href="https://bugbee.app">BugBee</a> to allow gathering reports directly from a game</li>
<li>Finish the pre-production of the &ldquo;small game&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Feb. - April 2025</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>New game production</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mai 2025</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>New game ready for release, but maybe wait for June next fest :)</li>
<li>Start looking for a new freelance contract for September</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-pre-production-phase">The pre-production phase</h3>
<p>The goal here is to prepare the tools and the workflow I&rsquo;ll need to make the game, and to have a clearer picture of what can be achieve in 3 months.</p>
<p>First, I started experimenting with level authoring in Godot:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>func_godot + Trenchbroom</strong><br>
Setup is pretty heavy, as well as adding new entities to the library.
Once everything is in place though, the workflow is simple and versatile.</li>
<li><strong>GodotVMF + Hammer++</strong><br>
To be tested, but I assume is really close to func_godot + Trenchbroom</li>
<li><strong>Blender</strong><br>
Likely the least efficient workflow, as entities must be placed manually in Godot. Each update in Blender might require updating entities in Godot, making it error-prone and time-consuming.</li>
<li><strong>Godot GridMap</strong><br>
While the workflow might be the simplest, adding new geometry will be a pain as each mesh will need to be created in Blender by hand.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once I&rsquo;m set on a workflow, I&rsquo;ll be able to make some Stupid Wild-Ass Guesstimates for the features and content I want in the game, then axe some of them to keep the scope in check.
I&rsquo;ll keep you all updated on the progress!</p>
<h3 id="new-year-list">New Year List</h3>
<p>I like lists, so naturally I made one for the stuff I want to do/play/read/watch :)<br>
In 2025, I&rsquo;m Looking Forward To:<br>
<strong>Continue</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Taking care of my health</li>
<li>Writing this blog</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Play</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe</li>
<li>Threshold</li>
<li>Mouthwashing</li>
<li>Gruun</li>
<li>1000xRESIST</li>
<li>Avowed?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Read</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The murderbot diary</li>
<li>16 ways to defend a walled city</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Watch</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Kaamelott : Deuxième Volet</li>
<li>Squid Game 2 part 2</li>
</ul>
<p>I guess this is it for this first post of the year!<br>
Talk to you soon.</p>

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m an independent developer in the video game industry, and my current project is slowly wrapping up. I have enough savings to cover about 10 months of expenses, which might sound like a lot to some.
But this looming uncertainty — distant as it may be — keeps me up at night. I am deeply worried about not being able to provide for my family, so I&amp;rsquo;ve sent out resume everywhere&amp;hellip; and I got a job offer.&lt;br>

<p>I&rsquo;m scared.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an independent developer in the video game industry, and my current project is slowly wrapping up. I have enough savings to cover about 10 months of expenses, which might sound like a lot to some.
But this looming uncertainty — distant as it may be — keeps me up at night. I am deeply worried about not being able to provide for my family, so I&rsquo;ve sent out resume everywhere&hellip; and I got a job offer.<br>
After hundreds of applications, tens of interviews, I got a job offer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting technical subject, even if it&rsquo;s not in the game industry. It&rsquo;s a 15 minute ride from where I live, the culture seems really chill&hellip; but there&rsquo;s a catch:</p>
<p><strong>no remote work</strong>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been fully remote since 2018, and it allowed me to spend more time with my daughters, work on side projects, and even have the space to feel not-so-great from time to time.
I&rsquo;m not sure if I can handle a fully in-office job anymore.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do a pros/cons list!</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>A stable job - Less money anxiety for me and my family</li>
<li>Working in one of the most advanced field in computer science</li>
<li>Literally 15 minutes away from my home</li>
<li>Flexible working hours</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>A stable job - I really like the <em>free</em> part of freelancer</li>
<li>Not in the game industry</li>
<li>No remote work</li>
<li>No remote work — not even a little</li>
<li>No remote work — not at all</li>
<li>No remote work — <strong>NONE</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>WELL, looks like there&rsquo;s more cons 🙂</p>
<p>The thing is, I would love to have a bit of a break, to get time to work on my game engine and release some games made with it, maybe stream the process a bit?
I&rsquo;ll need to summon the courage to stay unemployed though.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it, I&rsquo;m not caving, I&rsquo;m not taking the job.</p>
<p>I am not scared anymore.<br>
I will stay free, for now.</p>

&lt;p>Recently, the urge returned: I&amp;rsquo;ve been fixating on ways to cooperate differently, especially in the game industry, and I had to get it out of my system. My previous attempt at a blog was retired at the time, so I went for the fastest way to publish anything: a newsletter platform. I wrote two articles, and then the emails flooded in. &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;Grow your audience fast with fastaudiencegrowth&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>, &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;Subscribe to our premium platform and win your subscribers&amp;rsquo; weight in gold.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been journaling daily for about 10 years and, even in the privacy of my notebook, it&rsquo;s been incredibly effective at taming the beast inside my head.

<p>Recently, the urge returned: I&rsquo;ve been fixating on ways to cooperate differently, especially in the game industry, and I had to get it out of my system. My previous attempt at a blog was retired at the time, so I went for the fastest way to publish anything: a newsletter platform. I wrote two articles, and then the emails flooded in. <em>&ldquo;Grow your audience fast with fastaudiencegrowth&rdquo;</em>, <em>&ldquo;Subscribe to our premium platform and win your subscribers&rsquo; weight in gold.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Begone, devil! The void is my audience, and it shall not grow!</p>
<p>So, I dug back out my old blog, dusted it off, and published it again. I migrated the two articles and reclaimed my digital ownership! I even kept my old posts from 2022 — though I wouldn’t recommend diving too deep into them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was lucky to have my roots in websites because I always understood the value of building my own online spaces, and hosting everything that mattered to me on my own sites.<br>

</blockquote>
<p>I have always value my digital independence, and I self-host a lot of services. I also believe that, as long as you control the source material, not everything needs to be <em>strictly</em> self-hosted. For example, this blog is a static site hosted on github pages and, even if github stop offering the service, I can move it somewhere else without loosing anything.</p>
<p>Aside from that, I&rsquo;ve been playing through my backlog a lot lately:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ve finished Portal Stories: Mel, a nice story for people wanting more Portal.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve played a couple of chapters of Black Mesa, astonishing work!</li>
<li>I enjoyed Tinyfolks a lot. It&rsquo;s a tiny, more forgiving, Darkest Dungeon.</li>
<li>Clickholding: this one I can&rsquo;t say anything about, you&rsquo;d have to see it for yourself.</li>
<li>And lastly, I&rsquo;ve just started DREDGE, but I love it already :)</li>
</ul>
<p>Tinyfolks especially motivated me to start working on a tiny game - we&rsquo;ll see were it leads!</p>
<p>Until then, have a nice week and see you next time!</p>

<h2 id="lindustrie-du-jeu-vidéo">L&rsquo;industrie du jeu vidéo</h2>
<h3 id="la-nouvelle-crise">La nouvelle crise</h3>
<p>Vous n&rsquo;êtes pas sans savoir que, depuis 2022, l&rsquo;industrie du jeu vidéo ne se porte pas bien, mais alors pas bien du tout. Enfin, uniquement sur le plan social, parce que niveau revenus, c&rsquo;est toujours la fête. Konbini en a fait un petit résumé récemment.</p>
<p>Les causes de cette énième crise sont multiples : taux d&rsquo;intérêts historiquement haut, investissements nécessaires grandissant, temps de développement de plus en plus long et réajustement des usages à la sortie de la crise COVID.</p>
<p>Au final, là où le capitalisme cherche le profit à toujours plus court terme, on a l&rsquo;impression que les besoins de l&rsquo;industrie du jeu vidéo, notamment des grosses productions, sont complètement à contre-courant.</p>
<h3 id="des-petits-jeux">Des petits jeux</h3>
<p>La solution paraît donc évidente : allons vers des productions plus petites, qui demandent moins d&rsquo;investissements, donc moins de risques, et dont on peut récolter les fruits plus rapidement. Plusieurs développeurs prônent cette solution, notamment <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1efyve7/why_i_absolutely_love_making_small_games_and_why/">le créateur de Minami Lane, ici en anglais sur reddit</a> :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>La plupart des jeux ne se vendent pas. Lorsqu&rsquo;un éditeur investit 300k dans un petit jeu indé, il ne pense pas réellement que ce jeu ait une grande chance de rapporter plus de 300k. Il croit que parmi les 10 jeux qu&rsquo;il a signés, l&rsquo;un d&rsquo;eux va exploser et compenser tous ceux qui n&rsquo;auront vendu que quelques exemplaires. En tant qu&rsquo;indé ou petite équipe, vous prenez le même risque. Et si vous devez faire 10 jeux pour lisser ce risque, c&rsquo;est bien plus faisable si ces jeux prennent 3 mois à réaliser plutôt que 3 ans.<br>
— <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Traduit de la publication reddit de <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/GoDorian">u/GoDorian</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Je suis complètement d&rsquo;accord avec eux et j&rsquo;aimerais même aller un plus loin et voir comment on pourrait améliorer encore cette résilience. Plutôt que de lisser le risque sur 10 jeux, ne pourrait-on pas s&rsquo;associer avec des porteurs de projets différents, et atténuer les risques de chacun sur, par exemple, 3 jeux, deux projets agricoles et un projet de co-living ?</p>
<h2 id="vers-un-autre-modèle">Vers un autre modèle</h2>
<h3 id="coopérer">Coopérer</h3>
<p>Cette diversité d&rsquo;activité, on peut notamment la trouver dans les tiers-lieux, ces espaces partagés, dans lesquels coopèrent des citoyens engagés. Il en existait 3500 en France en 2023 selon <a href="https://francetierslieux.fr/">France Tiers-Lieux</a>, avec une projection à 5000 pour 2025.</p>
<p>La résilience n&rsquo;est pas inhérente à l&rsquo;espace lui-même mais, si celui-ci propose un atelier d&rsquo;artistes, un laboratoire partagé, un espace d&rsquo;expérimentations agricole ou encore d&rsquo;accueillir du public, il va attirer et mélanger des projets différents qui pourront, selon le cadre légal choisi, lisser le risque encouru par chacun. Cette coopération favorise également la créativité, chacun s’inspirant des différentes disciplines présentes.</p>
<p>Dans l&rsquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnpDxDV1SH4">interview d’Eloi Laurent, par Paloma Moritz</a>, qui revient sur son livre <a href="https://www.ruedelechiquier.net/essais/486-cooperer-et-se-faire-confiance.html">Coopérer et se faire confiance par tous les temps</a>, il est question de l&rsquo;importance essentielle de la coopération. Pour l&rsquo;économiste c&rsquo;est même, avec la Santé, l&rsquo;un des deux besoins humains fondamentaux. Il la définit comme la capacité unique des êtres humains à s&rsquo;associer pour réaliser des désirs et satisfaire des besoins, dans le temps long, au-delà d&rsquo;un rapport coût bénéfice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>La santé, au fond, c&rsquo;est ce qui nous relie à tous les autres vivants. La coopération, c&rsquo;est ce qui nous en distingue.<br>
— <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Eloi Laurent<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>Coopérer, ce n’est pas simplement collaborer pour produire. Ce n’est pas simplement une opération à somme nulle qui reviendrait à échanger son temps contre de la valeur. C’est construire ensemble des solutions à différents problèmes, où chacun repart avec plus que ce qu’il a apporté, que ce soit de la stabilité, de l’inspiration, ou simplement de la matière à réflexion.</p>
<h3 id="une-construction-sociale-durable">Une construction sociale durable</h3>
<p>En en parlant autour de moi, on m’a opposé à ce partage des risques par la coopération la différence de valeur entre des activités. “Pourquoi le développeur qui sort un hit devrait gagner autant que celui qui n’en a pas eu ?&quot;. Ma réponse primaire c’est de dire qu’il n’en a pas encore eu, et que, avec un peu de chance, le second en sortira un encore plus gros.</p>
<p>Mais en fait ce n’est pas le sujet. En ayant ce genre de discours, on évalue la valeur du travail avec celle du produit final. Hors, la valeur devrait être évaluée par l’acte lui-même du travail et même plus encore, attachée à la personne même qui effectue le travail.</p>
<p>Cette idée n’est pas de moi, c’est le principe du salaire à la personne de Bernard Friot : à partir de la majorité, chacun aurait le droit à un salaire à vie, en fonction de son grade, peu importe son travail. Je vous invite à regarder <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8qV4InhebQ">son interview par Salomé Saqué</a> portant sur <a href="https://ladispute.fr/catalogue/le-communisme-qui-vient">Le communisme qui vient</a>, son nouveau livre coécrit avec le philosophe Bernard Vasseur.</p>
<h3 id="les-sociétés-coopératives-de-production">Les sociétés coopératives de production</h3>
<p>On peut s’inspirer du salaire à la personne pour penser un nouveau modèle de rémunération dans une entreprise. On pourrait ainsi définir des grades dans les statuts et le conseil d’administration pourrait revisiter annuellement le salaire qui leur est lié, et déterminer quels sont les employés éligibles à une évolution de grade.</p>
<p>Pour que ce soit juste, chaque employé devrait pouvoir prétendre à une voix, et une seule, au conseil d’administration, et personne d’autre. Il existe déjà des entreprises avec des gouvernances similaires : les scops ou sociétés coopératives de production.</p>
<p>Dans la <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA3IpqdI7k0">masterclasse de Bastien Sibille</a>, on apprend que l’ensemble des coopératives représentent plus de 10% du PIB de la France en 2022 et, qu’en plus d’être démocratiques, elles présentent un autre avantage non négligeable : les dividendes octroyés aux sociétaires y sont limités, en effet, la loi impose que 57,5% du résultat net soit affecté aux réserves impartageables.</p>
<p>Ce modèle remet la gouvernance de l’entreprise, des moyens de production, dans les mains des employés, ce qui permet, selon moi, de répondre aux incertitudes de notre époque.</p>
<p>À celle du temps court, du besoin immédiat, de la nourriture et de l’énergie, qui a débuté avec l’invasion de l’Ukraine par la Russie, on y répond par un salaire égal pour tous, exempt du vampirisme des actionnaires. On y répond par une plus grande résilience, une production diverse et locale et la coopération de tous.</p>
<p>À celle du temps long, de la projection dans l’avenir et de l’apocalypse climatique qui vient, on y répond en donnant aux travailleurs le choix de leur action, et de pouvoir diriger leur entreprise vers l’avenir auquel ils aspirent.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Pour conclure, j’aimerais revenir sur les tiers-lieux, car se sont aussi de formidables lieux de transmission. Accueillir du public, notamment des écoles, peut être un excellent moyen de faire découvrir les métiers représentés, mais également de montrer qu’une autre construction sociale est possible, qu’elle fonctionne et qu’elle existe même près de chez-eux.</p>
<p>Je suis certain que la coopération est la clé d’une résilience généralisée, mais aussi que d’autres modèles sont à explorer. N’hésitez donc pas à me partager vos retours, vos suggestions et vos pistes de réflexion, je les attends avec impatience !</p>
<p>Merci de m’avoir lu jusqu’au bout !</p>
<p>À très vite,
Thibaud</p>

You have to sing it, you have to listen to it. Well, I tend to obsess like that about approximately everything. For example, I recently watched a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsbCSkvHhMo">great video on quantum computing</a> and, even though I didn’t want to, I had to try and build a simulator. I would rather be making games, working on my actual job, or keeping a good sleep schedule; I just can’t help myself.</p>
<p>Over the years, journaling helped me a lot with over-obsessing, and I hope this newsletter will help me even more!</p>
<h2 id="weird-games">Weird Games</h2>
<p>This week I watched a great video on weird games (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34NVLRHsxSU">part1</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBrkdcVam4U">part2</a>). The video itself is in French, with some parts in English, but subtitles, written by the author, are available in both languages.</p>
<p>In the intro, someone says “I’m pessimistic about the industry, but optimistic about the medium” and this resonated quite a lot with me. I do believe we have to create new ways of financing video game production and new collaboration models, maybe taking inspiration from what communities are building in some &ldquo;third places&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="a-place-to-grow-food-and-be-creative">A place to grow food and be creative</h2>
<p>By third places, or “tiers lieu” in French, I mean <a href="https://www.equaltimes.org/the-revolution-of-the-third-place?lang=en&amp;utm_source=rheneross-newsletter.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=rethinking-collaboration-models">community spaces to work, share and collaborate</a>. In France, a lot of them are built around farming, co-working, creating art, or making objects. I would love to combine something like that with making games. A place where people can come, even stay multiple days, eat local food from the farm, and build games. The closest initiative I found, minus the farming, is in Sweden: <a href="https://www.spelkollektivet.com/">https://www.spelkollektivet.com/</a>.</p>
<p>Third places are also built to be more resilient: everyone can help everywhere and risks are split between each person in the collective and each activity. You can have farmers selling different kinds of vegetables, or game developers building different experiences, and everything evens out in the end.</p>
<p>And finally, as a lot of third places are open to the public, it’s a nice opportunity to teach game development or playtest games!</p>
<p>Thanks for reading! I hope you enjoyed 🙂<br>
Feel free to respond and tell me what you thought of this first issue!</p>
<p>Have a great week,<br>
Thibaud</p>
