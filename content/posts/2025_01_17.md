Hey!

Hope everyone's doing great :)  
This was my 2nd work week of 2025, and wow, it was **PACKED**!

Outside of my current freelance project, I've been working on a game framework for my first commercial solo game, built with odin-lang and sokol.
My goal is to be able to build levels in [hammer++](https://ficool2.github.io/HammerPlusPlus-Website/index.html)---with a working compile & run action---and develop custom entities and game logic in odin.  

**Progress this week?**  
You bet! We can now:
- Move and look around in first person
- Render simple 3D shapes
- Load Source 2013 .bsp files
- Spawn the player at the `info_player_start` position, and find its location in the BSP Tree.  

Next up, I'll focus on rendering maps---starting without textures. Then I'll create the entrypoints & configuration to launch the game directly into the current map from Hammer++.
I aim to have everything setup by the end of the month, so I can start working on the actual game: a really small game where you try to exit a bunker without waking up the monster sleeping below.

I was also planning on releasing the new BugBee update, but I didn't get around to finishing it, maybe next week ðŸ¤ž.

I'm itching to get back to work, so I'll keep this short for today!  
Thanks for following along, and see you next time :)
