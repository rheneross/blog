Hey everyone,  
I hope you are all doing great!

This week, something really important happened in the game's industry: **a Strike!**  
Started by a French union---the STJV---the movement was also joined by CSVI-CGT in Spain. [You can read their demands here](https://www.stjv.fr/en/2025/02/video-game-industry-general-strike-what-demands/).  
If you want to support the effort, an [itch.io game bundle](https://itch.io/b/2891/grve-bundle-gg25) was created, with a lot of great games like **Pyrene** or **Minami Lane**!  

And apparently, the strike was a success!

The closest rally were more than 2 hours from where I live, so I observed the strike in my own way---by playing through *A Plague's Tale: Innocence*.  
I really enjoyed the game: the story hooked me right away, and I loved sneaking around guards and breaking their lanterns so they get swarmed by rats. Some said the infiltration was on rail, it didn't bother me at all.  
The only thing I found a little bit annoying was the menu to change projectiles.

I've also started Kingdom Come: Deliverance, the first one.  
I'm enjoying it so far, even though I must avoid an entire road because someone I've beaten in a Tourney is looking to kill me with a poison blade.  
We'll see what comes next!

That's all for this week, see you all next time!
