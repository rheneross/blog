&lt;p>This week I&amp;rsquo;ve made a lot of progress on my game: the first level blockout is nearly complete, and all the features are implemented already.&lt;br>
I will do a small family and friends playtest next week, and report back with the findings!&lt;/p>

I hope you are doing great :)</p>
<p>This week I&rsquo;ve made a lot of progress on my game: the first level blockout is nearly complete, and all the features are implemented already.<br>
I will do a small family and friends playtest next week, and report back with the findings!</p>
<p>In the meantime, let&rsquo;s dive a little bit into my Trenchbroom/Godot/FuncGodot setup.</p>
<p>First, let me tell you, I really enjoy the workflow!<br>
Here&rsquo;s a quick video showing it in action:<br>

</p>
<p>At the moment though, it&rsquo;s a bit tedious to add new 3D models.<br>
Here&rsquo;s what I have to do to make a model available in Trenchbroom:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create the model in blender, with the materials</li>
<li>Export the model as an glb to Godot</li>
<li>Create a Godot scene, with the model in it, rotate it to face the correct direction</li>
<li>Create an entity resource using the model</li>
<li>Export the entities library</li>
<li>Reload the entities in trenchbroom</li>
</ol>
<p>Next week, I&rsquo;ll create a Godot tool script to automatically generate props entities for each 3D model in a folder.</p>
<p>For reference, here&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;ve structured my project:</p>

&lt;p>This week, something really important happened in the game&amp;rsquo;s industry: &lt;strong>a Strike!&lt;/strong>&lt;br>

<p>This week, something really important happened in the game&rsquo;s industry: <strong>a Strike!</strong><br>
Started by a French union&mdash;the STJV&mdash;the movement was also joined by CSVI-CGT in Spain. <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2025/02/video-game-industry-general-strike-what-demands/">You can read their demands here</a>.<br>

</p>
<p>The closest rally were more than 2 hours from where I live, so I observed the strike in my own way&mdash;by playing through <em>A Plague&rsquo;s Tale: Innocence</em>.<br>
I really enjoyed the game: the story hooked me right away, and I loved sneaking around guards and breaking their lanterns so they get swarmed by rats. Some said the infiltration was on rail, it didn&rsquo;t bother me at all.<br>
The only thing I found a little bit annoying was the menu to change projectiles.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also started Kingdom Come: Deliverance, the first one.<br>
I&rsquo;m enjoying it so far, even though I must avoid an entire road because someone I&rsquo;ve beaten in a Tourney is looking to kill me with a poison blade.<br>
We&rsquo;ll see what comes next!</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for this week, see you all next time!</p>

<h2 id="blender-as-hammer">Blender as Hammer</h2>
<p>Yesterday, I saw some interesting posts by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/passivestar.bsky.social">passivestar</a> about using Blender as a Valve&rsquo;s Hammer level editor:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/passivestar.bsky.social/post/3lhldwwy56c2y">Making holes in level geometry</a></li>

<li><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/passivestar.bsky.social/post/3lgwiyfm2y22s">Polyhaven + ucupaint</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the list of Blender addons they are using:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://omnistep.atair.cc/">omnistep</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/passivestar/quickmenu">quickmenu</a></li>

<li><a href="https://extensions.blender.org/add-ons/copy-attributes-menu/">Copy Attributes Menu</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The workflow looked really smooth&mdash;also because they look amazing at Blender&mdash;and I started to think that I should try that for my game.</p>
<h2 id="resisting-the-sirens-of-procrastination">Resisting the sirens of procrastination</h2>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a trap I frequently fall into: trying to radically change my workflow after production has started&mdash;even if I quite like my current tools.
Especially for small games, it&rsquo;s often better to pin new techniques for later.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not only me, I&rsquo;ve seen countless productions where the team wanted to upgrade to the new major engine version, not to solve a problem, but to integrate a new tool.
It always leads to losing days fixing issues, while the new tool gets slowly abandoned because nothing is built to work with it in the current content pipeline.</p>
<p>Even early in production, I&rsquo;ll force myself to stick to my workflow&mdash;I have a game to make!</p>
<p>Have a great week, see you next time!</p>

The <em>MuskTrumpxiety</em> is hitting hard, and I don&rsquo;t even live in the US.<br>
I guess that&rsquo;s what happens when fascists are in charge of one of the most powerful countries in the world.
I hope you are all safe, wherever you are.</p>
<h2 id="clearing-socials">Clearing socials</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always kept my distance from social media. I have a LinkedIn account (asleep when I&rsquo;m not job hunting), as well as Reddit and Bluesky accounts.
I do use WhatsApp, but since Zuckerbro has pledged allegiance to the Trumpsks, I&rsquo;m moving away from it.<br>

Wish me luck!</p>
<h2 id="engine-progress">Engine progress</h2>
<p>In other news, I spent 3 days figuring out why my engine wouldn&rsquo;t render the .bsp map I had loaded. It was so frustrating, and as always, the issue turned out to be a dumb mistake. Working alone on something can be hard when you&rsquo;re stuck and need a fresh perspective&hellip; But it&rsquo;s all working now, so I&rsquo;ll celebrate by taking a break!<br>
Next week, I&rsquo;ll work on adding textures.</p>
<p>I can already feel some friction in the new texture workflow: adding them to Hammer++ requires converting my .png files to .vtf format and generating a .vmf material file.
It also means my engine will have to support .vtf and .vmf files. Alternatively, I could switch to Trenchbroom + ericw-tools with flat .png textures, which might be enough to achieve the look Iâ€™m after.<br>
That&rsquo;s a decision for next-week me.</p>
<p>Well, that was my week. Here&rsquo;s hoping yours went smoother!<br>
See you next time.</p>

<p>Hope everyone&rsquo;s doing great :)<br>
This was my 2nd work week of 2025, and wow, it was <strong>PACKED</strong>!</p>
<p>Outside of my current freelance project, I&rsquo;ve been working on a game framework for my first commercial solo game, built with odin-lang and sokol.
My goal is to be able to build levels in <a href="https://ficool2.github.io/HammerPlusPlus-Website/index.html">hammer++</a>&mdash;with a working compile &amp; run action&mdash;and develop custom entities and game logic in odin.</p>
<p><strong>Progress this week?</strong><br>
You bet! We can now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Move and look around in first person</li>
<li>Render simple 3D shapes</li>
<li>Load Source 2013 .bsp files</li>
<li>Spawn the player at the <code>info_player_start</code> position, and find its location in the BSP Tree.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next up, I&rsquo;ll focus on rendering maps&mdash;starting without textures. Then I&rsquo;ll create the entrypoints &amp; configuration to launch the game directly into the current map from Hammer++.
I aim to have everything setup by the end of the month, so I can start working on the actual game: a really small game where you try to exit a bunker without waking up the monster sleeping below.</p>
<p>I was also planning on releasing the new BugBee update, but I didn&rsquo;t get around to finishing it, maybe next week ðŸ¤ž.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m itching to get back to work, so I&rsquo;ll keep this short for today!<br>
Thanks for following along, and see you next time :)</p>

&lt;p>First I had this &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYtGl1dX5qI">old song&lt;/a> stuck in my head for most of the week. Sorry, I had to &lt;em>let it all out&lt;/em>!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="morning-pages">Morning Pages&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve started writing three A4 pages every morning before work. It&amp;rsquo;s excruciating&amp;mdash;I dread the moment all the way to my office&amp;mdash;but &lt;em>boy&lt;/em> does it feel good when it&amp;rsquo;s done.
It&amp;rsquo;s all coming from the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Artist%27s_Way">Artist&amp;rsquo;s Way&lt;/a> by Julia Cameron, and while I don&amp;rsquo;t enjoy the spiritual aspects of the book, I find the method interesting. I will be continuing the exercises through the start of the year, and try to report back on my progress here.&lt;/p></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s time to look back on the first work week of 2025 :)</p>
<p>First I had this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYtGl1dX5qI">old song</a> stuck in my head for most of the week. Sorry, I had to <em>let it all out</em>!</p>
<h2 id="morning-pages">Morning Pages</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve started writing three A4 pages every morning before work. It&rsquo;s excruciating&mdash;I dread the moment all the way to my office&mdash;but <em>boy</em> does it feel good when it&rsquo;s done.
It&rsquo;s all coming from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Artist%27s_Way">Artist&rsquo;s Way</a> by Julia Cameron, and while I don&rsquo;t enjoy the spiritual aspects of the book, I find the method interesting. I will be continuing the exercises through the start of the year, and try to report back on my progress here.</p>
<h2 id="multi-project-ing">Multi-project-ing</h2>
<p>Already, I found a positive side-effect of the morning pages: they help me sort my thoughts before starting the day.<br>
That &ldquo;<em>enlightenment</em>&rdquo; also pushed me to change the way I juggle my multiple projects.</p>
<p>Previously, I merged all my tasks into one massive todo list then, every morning, I would sit at my desk and select the tasks I needed to work on for the day&mdash;then proceed to work all day on completely different things.</p>
<p>Now, each task lives in a different place:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal / Administrative tasks: in Todoist, which I sort and prioritize every now and then</li>
<li>Client tasks: in the client task management system</li>
<li>Personal project tasks: in their own repository</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, every morning, after writing my pages, I check with myself if I want to work on one project or another, then proceed to work on tasks related to this project.<br>
If something urgent needs to be done, it&rsquo;s usually top of mind, so I handle it immediately.</p>
<p>With this new organization, I no longer feel like like I&rsquo;m behind on tasks. Instead, I&rsquo;m more focused on what I want to work one&mdash;like BugBee!</p>
<h2 id="bugbee">BugBee</h2>
<p><a href="https://bugbee.app">BugBee</a> is a Discord bot designed to help studios manage game feedback and bug reports efficiently. Currently, it allows you to gather player inputs directly from Discord.</p>
<p>With the next update&mdash;which should be live next week&mdash;I&rsquo;m adding an API that lets developers integrate feedback submission directly from their games. All reports will be funneled into the same Discord feedback channel, making it easy to track them. It&rsquo;s the final feature I wanted before actively talking about it!</p>
<h2 id="game1-pre-production">Game1 Pre-Production</h2>
<p>I also made some progress on selecting a content workflow for my next game. My current prototype, built with Godot + <a href="https://github.com/func-godot/func_godot_plugin">FuncGodot</a> + <a href="https://trenchbroom.github.io/">TrenchBroom</a>, works really well for what I want to achieve, buuuuut I wanted to try one last approach: I&rsquo;m experimenting with a prototype built without Godot, instead using <a href="https://odin-lang.org/">Odin</a> + <a href="https://github.com/floooh/sokol">Sokol</a> and having it load bsp maps from <a href="https://ficool2.github.io/HammerPlusPlus-Website/">Hammer++</a>.
I really like working without an editor&mdash;except for making maps obviously.</p>
<p>That said, I really need to get better at making levels :)</p>
<h2 id="i-also-played-some-games">I also played some games</h2>
<h3 id="enshrouded">Enshrouded</h3>
<p>This week, I tried Enshrouded with some friends and we all enjoyed it!<br>
What I like about it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Same feeling of exploration I had with Valheim, but less punitive</li>
<li>Magic chests that act as a remote inventory for crafting</li>
<li>Meaningful loots from monsters, not everything is obtained by crafting</li>
</ul>
<p>Things I don&rsquo;t like that much:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using NPC for crafting, I spend my time in base looking for them</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="balatro">Balatro</h3>
<p>I know I&rsquo;m late to the Balatro party, but I&rsquo;m glad I finally came: it&rsquo;s a hell of a party!<br>
Like everyone else, I&rsquo;m addicted!</p>
<hr>
<p>I believe that&rsquo;s all for this week!<br>
Talk to you next time :)</p>

&lt;p>I hope you all had a wonderful end of the year.

<p>I hope you all had a wonderful end of the year.
Not to be a Bilbo Braggins <strong>but</strong> I had the best New Year&rsquo;s Eve party ever: I went to bed at 22:30! Oh, the delights of old age.</p>
<h2 id="2024-was-a-big-year-for-me">2024 was a big year for me!</h2>
<p>I wanted to work as a freelancer for about 10 years now, and I finally took the jump last February. I started with a perfect first contract: a year-long project, which gave me plenty of time to adjust to the new required  administrative chores, without worrying too much about finding gigs. It was also the opportunity to work with Unreal Engine, which I didn&rsquo;t do professionally before.</p>
<p>By summer, I was feeling quite comfortable&mdash;read bored&mdash;in my new life and decided to focus on making a game of my own. After working on a grant application for a while, I realized my initial idea was too ambitious for a first project. So, I decided to shelve it for now and focus on something smaller&mdash;something I could complete by myself before mid-2025. Eventually, I settled on a small, liminal Half-Life game, set in the universe of my &ldquo;big game&rdquo;.</p>
<p>After having to&mdash;emotionally&mdash;survive a surgical procedure in September, I also became more mindful of my health. I started improving my diet and exercising regularly, loosing 5 kg in 4 months.</p>
<p>Another highlight of the year was shipping the first alpha version of <a href="https://bugbee.app">BugBee</a>, a Discord bot designed to help studios manage game feedback. There&rsquo;s still one key feature I&rsquo;d like to add before starting to talk about it thought.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for 2024, let&rsquo;s see what the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAE9AgseCW8">sequel</a> has in store!</p>
<h2 id="2025">2025</h2>
<p>With my current freelancing project coming to an end in February, I can support myself until October included. As I discussed in a <a href="/posts/2024_12_13/">previous post</a>, I&rsquo;m fully anxious about the deadline, but before focusing on finding a new freelance contract, I want to release a game. So I made a quick plan for the start of the year.</p>
<h3 id="the-plan">The plan</h3>
<p><strong>Jan. 2025</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Add an endpoint in <a href="https://bugbee.app">BugBee</a> to allow gathering reports directly from a game</li>
<li>Finish the pre-production of the &ldquo;small game&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Feb. - April 2025</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>New game production</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mai 2025</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>New game ready for release, but maybe wait for June next fest :)</li>
<li>Start looking for a new freelance contract for September</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-pre-production-phase">The pre-production phase</h3>
<p>The goal here is to prepare the tools and the workflow I&rsquo;ll need to make the game, and to have a clearer picture of what can be achieve in 3 months.</p>
<p>First, I started experimenting with level authoring in Godot:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>func_godot + Trenchbroom</strong><br>
Setup is pretty heavy, as well as adding new entities to the library.
Once everything is in place though, the workflow is simple and versatile.</li>
<li><strong>GodotVMF + Hammer++</strong><br>
To be tested, but I assume is really close to func_godot + Trenchbroom</li>
<li><strong>Blender</strong><br>
Likely the least efficient workflow, as entities must be placed manually in Godot. Each update in Blender might require updating entities in Godot, making it error-prone and time-consuming.</li>
<li><strong>Godot GridMap</strong><br>
While the workflow might be the simplest, adding new geometry will be a pain as each mesh will need to be created in Blender by hand.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once I&rsquo;m set on a workflow, I&rsquo;ll be able to make some Stupid Wild-Ass Guesstimates for the features and content I want in the game, then axe some of them to keep the scope in check.
I&rsquo;ll keep you all updated on the progress!</p>
<h3 id="new-year-list">New Year List</h3>
<p>I like lists, so naturally I made one for the stuff I want to do/play/read/watch :)<br>
In 2025, I&rsquo;m Looking Forward To:<br>
<strong>Continue</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Taking care of my health</li>
<li>Writing this blog</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Play</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe</li>
<li>Threshold</li>
<li>Mouthwashing</li>
<li>Gruun</li>
<li>1000xRESIST</li>
<li>Avowed?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Read</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The murderbot diary</li>
<li>16 ways to defend a walled city</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Watch</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Kaamelott : DeuxiÃ¨me Volet</li>
<li>Squid Game 2 part 2</li>
</ul>
<p>I guess this is it for this first post of the year!<br>
Talk to you soon.</p>

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m scared.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m an independent developer in the video game industry, and my current project is slowly wrapping up. I have enough savings to cover about 10 months of expenses, which might sound like a lot to some.
But this looming uncertainty â€” distant as it may be â€” keeps me up at night. I am deeply worried about not being able to provide for my family, so I&amp;rsquo;ve sent out resume everywhere&amp;hellip; and I got a job offer.&lt;br>
After hundreds of applications, tens of interviews, I got a job offer.&lt;/p></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM-CIvMEqUs">Don&rsquo;t make lemonade</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m scared.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an independent developer in the video game industry, and my current project is slowly wrapping up. I have enough savings to cover about 10 months of expenses, which might sound like a lot to some.
But this looming uncertainty â€” distant as it may be â€” keeps me up at night. I am deeply worried about not being able to provide for my family, so I&rsquo;ve sent out resume everywhere&hellip; and I got a job offer.<br>
After hundreds of applications, tens of interviews, I got a job offer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting technical subject, even if it&rsquo;s not in the game industry. It&rsquo;s a 15 minute ride from where I live, the culture seems really chill&hellip; but there&rsquo;s a catch:</p>
<p><strong>no remote work</strong>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been fully remote since 2018, and it allowed me to spend more time with my daughters, work on side projects, and even have the space to feel not-so-great from time to time.
I&rsquo;m not sure if I can handle a fully in-office job anymore.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do a pros/cons list!</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>A stable job - Less money anxiety for me and my family</li>
<li>Working in one of the most advanced field in computer science</li>
<li>Literally 15 minutes away from my home</li>
<li>Flexible working hours</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>A stable job - I really like the <em>free</em> part of freelancer</li>
<li>Not in the game industry</li>
<li>No remote work</li>
<li>No remote work â€” not even a little</li>
<li>No remote work â€” not at all</li>
<li>No remote work â€” <strong>NONE</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>WELL, looks like there&rsquo;s more cons ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>The thing is, I would love to have a bit of a break, to get time to work on my game engine and release some games made with it, maybe stream the process a bit?
I&rsquo;ll need to summon the courage to stay unemployed though.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it, I&rsquo;m not caving, I&rsquo;m not taking the job.</p>
<p>I am not scared anymore.<br>
I will stay free, for now.</p>
