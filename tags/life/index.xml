<p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p>This week I wanted to talk about task management again.<br>
Well, actually, it&rsquo;s more about doing the work.</p>
<p>Basically, last week was a mess.<br>
I did not finish the pre-production of my game and this post is very late.</p>
<p>So, what happened?</p>
<h2 id="distractions">Distractions</h2>
<p>One of the first things I blame when I feel like I didn&rsquo;t achieve as much, is task management.<br>
I know, it&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>Most of the time, the issue is Twitch, Youtube or whatever new horrible thing the government did yesterday.<br>
Suddenly I&rsquo;m learning how that guy did this, how to graft fruit trees, or how to get involved and try to stop the rise of fascism.
Yesterday, I spent an entire hour looking for a farm to buy in the middle of nowhere&hellip;</p>
<p>But yeah, it must be task management. So let&rsquo;s rebuild how I capture, schedule and organize tasks. Let&rsquo;s update my Obsidian dashboard, and maybe some of my neovim configuration&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="reflecting">Reflecting</h2>
<p>Stop. Put down the yaml file.<br>
What did I really do last week?</p>
<p>One thing in particular I&rsquo;m happy with: I did release <a href="https://bugbee.app">BugBee</a>&rsquo;s new update, and I did start to talk about it.
Outside of all the procrastination we already discussed, I also delivered the freelance I was paid for.</p>
<p>So, I should feel pretty good about last week, right?<br>
Well, it&rsquo;s not so simple, because there&rsquo;s a big difference between what I want to be doing, and what I have to do.</p>
<h3 id="what-i-want-to-be-doing">What I want to be doing</h3>
<p>In my wildest dreams, I want to take care of a small farm, raising a mix of animals and cultivating veggies, while still making small solo indie games.
In my head, I imagine working mostly in the farm from March to October, with a bit of time for game dev, and working mostly on games from November to February.</p>
<h3 id="what-i-need-to-be-doing">What I need to be doing</h3>
<p>At the moment though, I need to provide for my family, so I basically need to work.<br>
While I&rsquo;m waiting for the big move though, I am learning and preparing by growing some vegetables in my backyard, along with some hens. I&rsquo;m also working on a solo game&mdash;whose pre-production I did not finish in time.</p>
<h2 id="sometimes-it-is-organization">Sometimes, it is organization</h2>
<p>What&rsquo;s tricky is, sometimes it <strong>is</strong> a task management issue.<br>
This morning I spent 10 minutes organizing my week, and by the end of the day I accomplished more than last Thursday and Friday combined.</p>
<p>Sometimes a little structure really does help. Either way, I&rsquo;m going to keep trying. See you Friday!</p>

The &lt;em>MuskTrumpxiety&lt;/em> is hitting hard, and I don&amp;rsquo;t even live in the US.&lt;br>
I guess that&amp;rsquo;s what happens when fascists are in charge of one of the most powerful countries in the world.
I hope you are all safe, wherever you are.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="clearing-socials">Clearing socials&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve always kept my distance from social media. I have a LinkedIn account (asleep when I&amp;rsquo;m not job hunting), as well as Reddit and Bluesky accounts.
I do use WhatsApp, but since Zuckerbro has pledged allegiance to the Trumpsks, I&amp;rsquo;m moving away from it.&lt;br>
It is a slow and hard process: You need to ask all your contacts to move to something else&amp;mdash;&lt;a href="https://signal.org">Signal&lt;/a> in this case&amp;mdash;and people don&amp;rsquo;t want to install yet another messaging app.
Still, I&amp;rsquo;m already facing the final boss: migrating the family group chat. Classic text messages will do for everyone else.&lt;br>
Wish me luck!&lt;/p></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What an HORRIBLE week!<br>
The <em>MuskTrumpxiety</em> is hitting hard, and I don&rsquo;t even live in the US.<br>
I guess that&rsquo;s what happens when fascists are in charge of one of the most powerful countries in the world.
I hope you are all safe, wherever you are.</p>
<h2 id="clearing-socials">Clearing socials</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always kept my distance from social media. I have a LinkedIn account (asleep when I&rsquo;m not job hunting), as well as Reddit and Bluesky accounts.
I do use WhatsApp, but since Zuckerbro has pledged allegiance to the Trumpsks, I&rsquo;m moving away from it.<br>
It is a slow and hard process: You need to ask all your contacts to move to something else&mdash;<a href="https://signal.org">Signal</a> in this case&mdash;and people don&rsquo;t want to install yet another messaging app.
Still, I&rsquo;m already facing the final boss: migrating the family group chat. Classic text messages will do for everyone else.<br>
Wish me luck!</p>
<h2 id="engine-progress">Engine progress</h2>
<p>In other news, I spent 3 days figuring out why my engine wouldn&rsquo;t render the .bsp map I had loaded. It was so frustrating, and as always, the issue turned out to be a dumb mistake. Working alone on something can be hard when you&rsquo;re stuck and need a fresh perspective&hellip; But it&rsquo;s all working now, so I&rsquo;ll celebrate by taking a break!<br>
Next week, I&rsquo;ll work on adding textures.</p>
<p>I can already feel some friction in the new texture workflow: adding them to Hammer++ requires converting my .png files to .vtf format and generating a .vmf material file.
It also means my engine will have to support .vtf and .vmf files. Alternatively, I could switch to Trenchbroom + ericw-tools with flat .png textures, which might be enough to achieve the look I’m after.<br>
That&rsquo;s a decision for next-week me.</p>
<p>Well, that was my week. Here&rsquo;s hoping yours went smoother!<br>
See you next time.</p>

&lt;p>First I had this &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYtGl1dX5qI">old song&lt;/a> stuck in my head for most of the week. Sorry, I had to &lt;em>let it all out&lt;/em>!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="morning-pages">Morning Pages&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve started writing three A4 pages every morning before work. It&amp;rsquo;s excruciating&amp;mdash;I dread the moment all the way to my office&amp;mdash;but &lt;em>boy&lt;/em> does it feel good when it&amp;rsquo;s done.
It&amp;rsquo;s all coming from the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Artist%27s_Way">Artist&amp;rsquo;s Way&lt;/a> by Julia Cameron, and while I don&amp;rsquo;t enjoy the spiritual aspects of the book, I find the method interesting. I will be continuing the exercises through the start of the year, and try to report back on my progress here.&lt;/p></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s time to look back on the first work week of 2025 :)</p>
<p>First I had this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYtGl1dX5qI">old song</a> stuck in my head for most of the week. Sorry, I had to <em>let it all out</em>!</p>
<h2 id="morning-pages">Morning Pages</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve started writing three A4 pages every morning before work. It&rsquo;s excruciating&mdash;I dread the moment all the way to my office&mdash;but <em>boy</em> does it feel good when it&rsquo;s done.
It&rsquo;s all coming from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Artist%27s_Way">Artist&rsquo;s Way</a> by Julia Cameron, and while I don&rsquo;t enjoy the spiritual aspects of the book, I find the method interesting. I will be continuing the exercises through the start of the year, and try to report back on my progress here.</p>
<h2 id="multi-project-ing">Multi-project-ing</h2>
<p>Already, I found a positive side-effect of the morning pages: they help me sort my thoughts before starting the day.<br>
That &ldquo;<em>enlightenment</em>&rdquo; also pushed me to change the way I juggle my multiple projects.</p>
<p>Previously, I merged all my tasks into one massive todo list then, every morning, I would sit at my desk and select the tasks I needed to work on for the day&mdash;then proceed to work all day on completely different things.</p>
<p>Now, each task lives in a different place:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal / Administrative tasks: in Todoist, which I sort and prioritize every now and then</li>
<li>Client tasks: in the client task management system</li>
<li>Personal project tasks: in their own repository</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, every morning, after writing my pages, I check with myself if I want to work on one project or another, then proceed to work on tasks related to this project.<br>
If something urgent needs to be done, it&rsquo;s usually top of mind, so I handle it immediately.</p>
<p>With this new organization, I no longer feel like like I&rsquo;m behind on tasks. Instead, I&rsquo;m more focused on what I want to work one&mdash;like BugBee!</p>
<h2 id="bugbee">BugBee</h2>
<p><a href="https://bugbee.app">BugBee</a> is a Discord bot designed to help studios manage game feedback and bug reports efficiently. Currently, it allows you to gather player inputs directly from Discord.</p>
<p>With the next update&mdash;which should be live next week&mdash;I&rsquo;m adding an API that lets developers integrate feedback submission directly from their games. All reports will be funneled into the same Discord feedback channel, making it easy to track them. It&rsquo;s the final feature I wanted before actively talking about it!</p>
<h2 id="game1-pre-production">Game1 Pre-Production</h2>
<p>I also made some progress on selecting a content workflow for my next game. My current prototype, built with Godot + <a href="https://github.com/func-godot/func_godot_plugin">FuncGodot</a> + <a href="https://trenchbroom.github.io/">TrenchBroom</a>, works really well for what I want to achieve, buuuuut I wanted to try one last approach: I&rsquo;m experimenting with a prototype built without Godot, instead using <a href="https://odin-lang.org/">Odin</a> + <a href="https://github.com/floooh/sokol">Sokol</a> and having it load bsp maps from <a href="https://ficool2.github.io/HammerPlusPlus-Website/">Hammer++</a>.
I really like working without an editor&mdash;except for making maps obviously.</p>
<p>That said, I really need to get better at making levels :)</p>
<h2 id="i-also-played-some-games">I also played some games</h2>
<h3 id="enshrouded">Enshrouded</h3>
<p>This week, I tried Enshrouded with some friends and we all enjoyed it!<br>
What I like about it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Same feeling of exploration I had with Valheim, but less punitive</li>
<li>Magic chests that act as a remote inventory for crafting</li>
<li>Meaningful loots from monsters, not everything is obtained by crafting</li>
</ul>
<p>Things I don&rsquo;t like that much:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using NPC for crafting, I spend my time in base looking for them</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="balatro">Balatro</h3>
<p>I know I&rsquo;m late to the Balatro party, but I&rsquo;m glad I finally came: it&rsquo;s a hell of a party!<br>
Like everyone else, I&rsquo;m addicted!</p>
<hr>
<p>I believe that&rsquo;s all for this week!<br>
Talk to you next time :)</p>

&lt;p>I hope you all had a wonderful end of the year.

<p>I hope you all had a wonderful end of the year.
Not to be a Bilbo Braggins <strong>but</strong> I had the best New Year&rsquo;s Eve party ever: I went to bed at 22:30! Oh, the delights of old age.</p>
<h2 id="2024-was-a-big-year-for-me">2024 was a big year for me!</h2>
<p>I wanted to work as a freelancer for about 10 years now, and I finally took the jump last February. I started with a perfect first contract: a year-long project, which gave me plenty of time to adjust to the new required  administrative chores, without worrying too much about finding gigs. It was also the opportunity to work with Unreal Engine, which I didn&rsquo;t do professionally before.</p>
<p>By summer, I was feeling quite comfortable&mdash;read bored&mdash;in my new life and decided to focus on making a game of my own. After working on a grant application for a while, I realized my initial idea was too ambitious for a first project. So, I decided to shelve it for now and focus on something smaller&mdash;something I could complete by myself before mid-2025. Eventually, I settled on a small, liminal Half-Life game, set in the universe of my &ldquo;big game&rdquo;.</p>
<p>After having to&mdash;emotionally&mdash;survive a surgical procedure in September, I also became more mindful of my health. I started improving my diet and exercising regularly, loosing 5 kg in 4 months.</p>
<p>Another highlight of the year was shipping the first alpha version of <a href="https://bugbee.app">BugBee</a>, a Discord bot designed to help studios manage game feedback. There&rsquo;s still one key feature I&rsquo;d like to add before starting to talk about it thought.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for 2024, let&rsquo;s see what the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAE9AgseCW8">sequel</a> has in store!</p>
<h2 id="2025">2025</h2>
<p>With my current freelancing project coming to an end in February, I can support myself until October included. As I discussed in a <a href="/posts/2024_12_13/">previous post</a>, I&rsquo;m fully anxious about the deadline, but before focusing on finding a new freelance contract, I want to release a game. So I made a quick plan for the start of the year.</p>
<h3 id="the-plan">The plan</h3>
<p><strong>Jan. 2025</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Add an endpoint in <a href="https://bugbee.app">BugBee</a> to allow gathering reports directly from a game</li>
<li>Finish the pre-production of the &ldquo;small game&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Feb. - April 2025</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>New game production</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mai 2025</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>New game ready for release, but maybe wait for June next fest :)</li>
<li>Start looking for a new freelance contract for September</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-pre-production-phase">The pre-production phase</h3>
<p>The goal here is to prepare the tools and the workflow I&rsquo;ll need to make the game, and to have a clearer picture of what can be achieve in 3 months.</p>
<p>First, I started experimenting with level authoring in Godot:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>func_godot + Trenchbroom</strong><br>
Setup is pretty heavy, as well as adding new entities to the library.
Once everything is in place though, the workflow is simple and versatile.</li>
<li><strong>GodotVMF + Hammer++</strong><br>
To be tested, but I assume is really close to func_godot + Trenchbroom</li>
<li><strong>Blender</strong><br>
Likely the least efficient workflow, as entities must be placed manually in Godot. Each update in Blender might require updating entities in Godot, making it error-prone and time-consuming.</li>
<li><strong>Godot GridMap</strong><br>
While the workflow might be the simplest, adding new geometry will be a pain as each mesh will need to be created in Blender by hand.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once I&rsquo;m set on a workflow, I&rsquo;ll be able to make some Stupid Wild-Ass Guesstimates for the features and content I want in the game, then axe some of them to keep the scope in check.
I&rsquo;ll keep you all updated on the progress!</p>
<h3 id="new-year-list">New Year List</h3>
<p>I like lists, so naturally I made one for the stuff I want to do/play/read/watch :)<br>
In 2025, I&rsquo;m Looking Forward To:<br>
<strong>Continue</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Taking care of my health</li>
<li>Writing this blog</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Play</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe</li>
<li>Threshold</li>
<li>Mouthwashing</li>
<li>Gruun</li>
<li>1000xRESIST</li>
<li>Avowed?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Read</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The murderbot diary</li>
<li>16 ways to defend a walled city</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Watch</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Kaamelott : Deuxième Volet</li>
<li>Squid Game 2 part 2</li>
</ul>
<p>I guess this is it for this first post of the year!<br>
Talk to you soon.</p>

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m an independent developer in the video game industry, and my current project is slowly wrapping up. I have enough savings to cover about 10 months of expenses, which might sound like a lot to some.
But this looming uncertainty — distant as it may be — keeps me up at night. I am deeply worried about not being able to provide for my family, so I&amp;rsquo;ve sent out resume everywhere&amp;hellip; and I got a job offer.&lt;br>

<p>I&rsquo;m scared.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an independent developer in the video game industry, and my current project is slowly wrapping up. I have enough savings to cover about 10 months of expenses, which might sound like a lot to some.
But this looming uncertainty — distant as it may be — keeps me up at night. I am deeply worried about not being able to provide for my family, so I&rsquo;ve sent out resume everywhere&hellip; and I got a job offer.<br>
After hundreds of applications, tens of interviews, I got a job offer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting technical subject, even if it&rsquo;s not in the game industry. It&rsquo;s a 15 minute ride from where I live, the culture seems really chill&hellip; but there&rsquo;s a catch:</p>
<p><strong>no remote work</strong>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been fully remote since 2018, and it allowed me to spend more time with my daughters, work on side projects, and even have the space to feel not-so-great from time to time.
I&rsquo;m not sure if I can handle a fully in-office job anymore.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do a pros/cons list!</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>A stable job - Less money anxiety for me and my family</li>
<li>Working in one of the most advanced field in computer science</li>
<li>Literally 15 minutes away from my home</li>
<li>Flexible working hours</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>A stable job - I really like the <em>free</em> part of freelancer</li>
<li>Not in the game industry</li>
<li>No remote work</li>
<li>No remote work — not even a little</li>
<li>No remote work — not at all</li>
<li>No remote work — <strong>NONE</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>WELL, looks like there&rsquo;s more cons 🙂</p>
<p>The thing is, I would love to have a bit of a break, to get time to work on my game engine and release some games made with it, maybe stream the process a bit?
I&rsquo;ll need to summon the courage to stay unemployed though.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it, I&rsquo;m not caving, I&rsquo;m not taking the job.</p>
<p>I am not scared anymore.<br>
I will stay free, for now.</p>

Sometimes, though, I feel the urge to write something public and share it with the void.</p>
<p>Recently, the urge returned: I&rsquo;ve been fixating on ways to cooperate differently, especially in the game industry, and I had to get it out of my system. My previous attempt at a blog was retired at the time, so I went for the fastest way to publish anything: a newsletter platform. I wrote two articles, and then the emails flooded in. <em>&ldquo;Grow your audience fast with fastaudiencegrowth&rdquo;</em>, <em>&ldquo;Subscribe to our premium platform and win your subscribers&rsquo; weight in gold.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Begone, devil! The void is my audience, and it shall not grow!</p>
<p>So, I dug back out my old blog, dusted it off, and published it again. I migrated the two articles and reclaimed my digital ownership! I even kept my old posts from 2022 — though I wouldn’t recommend diving too deep into them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was lucky to have my roots in websites because I always understood the value of building my own online spaces, and hosting everything that mattered to me on my own sites.<br>
— <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://www.nathalielawhead.com/candybox/positive-feedback-loops-the-power-of-choice-digital-independence-and-building-something-better-for-everyone">Nathalie Lawhead</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have always value my digital independence, and I self-host a lot of services. I also believe that, as long as you control the source material, not everything needs to be <em>strictly</em> self-hosted. For example, this blog is a static site hosted on github pages and, even if github stop offering the service, I can move it somewhere else without loosing anything.</p>
<p>Aside from that, I&rsquo;ve been playing through my backlog a lot lately:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ve finished Portal Stories: Mel, a nice story for people wanting more Portal.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve played a couple of chapters of Black Mesa, astonishing work!</li>
<li>I enjoyed Tinyfolks a lot. It&rsquo;s a tiny, more forgiving, Darkest Dungeon.</li>
<li>Clickholding: this one I can&rsquo;t say anything about, you&rsquo;d have to see it for yourself.</li>
<li>And lastly, I&rsquo;ve just started DREDGE, but I love it already :)</li>
</ul>
<p>Tinyfolks especially motivated me to start working on a tiny game - we&rsquo;ll see were it leads!</p>
<p>Until then, have a nice week and see you next time!</p>

You have to sing it, you have to listen to it. Well, I tend to obsess like that about approximately everything. For example, I recently watched a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsbCSkvHhMo">great video on quantum computing</a> and, even though I didn’t want to, I had to try and build a simulator. I would rather be making games, working on my actual job, or keeping a good sleep schedule; I just can’t help myself.</p>
<p>Over the years, journaling helped me a lot with over-obsessing, and I hope this newsletter will help me even more!</p>
<h2 id="weird-games">Weird Games</h2>
<p>This week I watched a great video on weird games (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34NVLRHsxSU">part1</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBrkdcVam4U">part2</a>). The video itself is in French, with some parts in English, but subtitles, written by the author, are available in both languages.</p>
<p>In the intro, someone says “I’m pessimistic about the industry, but optimistic about the medium” and this resonated quite a lot with me. I do believe we have to create new ways of financing video game production and new collaboration models, maybe taking inspiration from what communities are building in some &ldquo;third places&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="a-place-to-grow-food-and-be-creative">A place to grow food and be creative</h2>
<p>By third places, or “tiers lieu” in French, I mean <a href="https://www.equaltimes.org/the-revolution-of-the-third-place?lang=en&amp;utm_source=rheneross-newsletter.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=rethinking-collaboration-models">community spaces to work, share and collaborate</a>. In France, a lot of them are built around farming, co-working, creating art, or making objects. I would love to combine something like that with making games. A place where people can come, even stay multiple days, eat local food from the farm, and build games. The closest initiative I found, minus the farming, is in Sweden: <a href="https://www.spelkollektivet.com/">https://www.spelkollektivet.com/</a>.</p>
<p>Third places are also built to be more resilient: everyone can help everywhere and risks are split between each person in the collective and each activity. You can have farmers selling different kinds of vegetables, or game developers building different experiences, and everything evens out in the end.</p>
<p>And finally, as a lot of third places are open to the public, it’s a nice opportunity to teach game development or playtest games!</p>
<p>Thanks for reading! I hope you enjoyed 🙂<br>
Feel free to respond and tell me what you thought of this first issue!</p>
<p>Have a great week,<br>
